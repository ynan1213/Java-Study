$h1 Apache Log4j ${relVersion} Release Notes

The ${developmentTeam} is pleased to announce the Log4j ${relVersion} release!

Apache Log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade
to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides
many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging,
property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a PatternLayout and asynchronous
Loggers. Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be "garbage-free" (avoid allocating
temporary objects) while logging. In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

The artifacts may be downloaded from https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html.

This release primarily contains bug fixes and minor enhancements.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
log4j-slf4j-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and log4j-slf4j2-impl should be used with SLF4J 2.x and
later. SLF4J-1.8.x is no longer supported as a GA release never occurred.

The Log4j ${relVersion} API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

## Hack to improve layout: replace all pairs of spaces with a single new-line
