 * A reference-counted object that requires explicit deallocation.
 *  一个引用计数的对象需要进行显示回收
 * <p>
 * When a new {@link ReferenceCounted} is instantiated, it starts with the reference count of {@code 1}.
 * {@link #retain()} increases the reference count, and {@link #release()} decreases the reference count.
 * 当我们创建一个ReferenceConuted时, 它会从1开始计数, retain() 加1   release() 减1
 *
 * If the reference count is decreased to {@code 0}, the object will be deallocated explicitly, and accessing
 * the deallocated object will usually result in an access violation.
 * 计数一旦为0 对象就会被回收
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an object that implements {@link ReferenceCounted} is a container of other objects that implement
 * {@link ReferenceCounted}, the contained objects will also be released via {@link #release()} when the container's
 * reference count becomes 0.
 * </p>  假如一个容器中有很多东西, 当这个容器的 referenceCount为0时, 这个容器里面的对象同样会被释放
