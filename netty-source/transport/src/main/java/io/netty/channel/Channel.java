/**
 * A nexus to a network socket or a component which is capable of I/O
 * operations such as read, write, connect, and bind.
 * <p>
 *      Channel 是一个连接点, 通过他可以进行IO或者网络Socket的 读,写,连接,绑定的操作
 *
 * A channel provides a user:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the current state of the channel (e.g. is it open? is it connected?),</li>
 *      向用户提供当前的状态
 * <li>the {@linkplain ChannelConfig configuration parameters} of the channel (e.g. receive buffer size),</li>
 *      向用户提供  关于 channel 的配置信息, 比如说可接受的缓冲区的大小
 * <li>the I/O operations that the channel supports (e.g. read, write, connect, and bind), and</li>
 *      channel 支持 IO操作, 读,写,连接绑定
 * <li>the {@link ChannelPipeline} which handles all I/O events and requests
 *     associated with the channel.</li>
 * </ul>
 *      !!! - 它提供了一个ChannelPipeline,他可以操纵所有的IO事件,以及处理和这个通道关联的请求
 *      她其实是一个 Handler 的链条
 *
 * <h3>All I/O operations are asynchronous.</h3>
 * <p>
 *      所有的IO操作都是  异步的!!!
 *
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will
 * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has
 * been completed at the end of the call.
 *      Netty中所有的IO操作都是异步的,一旦使用就返回, 这使得他就不能保证调用完了IO操作后, 数据就真的传递完成了
 *
 * Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which will notify you when the requested I/O
 * operation has succeeded, failed, or canceled.
 *      相反,IO操作会返回一个ChannelFuture对象, 通过这个对象,去判断IO操作是否完成
 *
 * <h3>Channels are hierarchical</h3>
 * <p>
 *    Channel是可继承的
 *
 * A {@link Channel} can have a {@linkplain #parent() parent} depending on
 * how it was created.  For instance, a {@link SocketChannel}, that was accepted
 * by {@link ServerSocketChannel}, will return the {@link ServerSocketChannel}
 * as its parent on {@link #parent()}.
 * <p>
 *     比如,  SocketChannel是ServerSocketChannel的accept方法获取的, 把ServerSocketChannel看成SocketChannel的父类
 *     所以,  SocketChannel 的parent方法,返回的就是 ServerSocketChannel
 *
 * The semantics of the hierarchical structure depends on the transport
 * implementation where the {@link Channel} belongs to.  For example, you could
 * write a new {@link Channel} implementation that creates the sub-channels that
 * share one socket connection, as <a href="http://beepcore.org/">BEEP</a> and
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> do.
 *
 * <h3>Downcast to access transport-specific operations</h3>
 * <p>
 * Some transports exposes additional operations that is specific to the
 * transport.  Down-cast the {@link Channel} to sub-type to invoke such
 * operations.  For example, with the old I/O datagram transport, multicast
 * join / leave operations are provided by {@link DatagramChannel}.
 *      channel是有继承层次的,  有些数据的传输需要添加额外的条件,所以我们向下转换
 *      ,比如说,在老式的 数据报I/O 中, 多重的join和leave是由 DatagramChannel完成的,因此我们向下转换
 *
 * <h3>Release resources</h3>
 * <p>
 * It is important to call {@link #close()} or {@link #close(ChannelPromise)} to release all
 * resources once you are done with the {@link Channel}. This ensures all resources are
 * released in a proper way, i.e. filehandles.
 *     使用完了channel之后我们很有需要调用  close()方法释放资源, 比如释放文件句柄, 这个方法,确保所有的资源被适当的释放掉
 *     定义在 Chanel中的 unsafe接口中
