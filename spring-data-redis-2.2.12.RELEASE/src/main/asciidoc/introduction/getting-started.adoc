= Getting Started

This section provides an easy-to-follow guide for getting started with the Spring Data Redis module.

[[get-started:first-steps]]
== First Steps

As explained in <<why-spring-redis>>, Spring Data Redis (SDR) provides integration between the Spring framework and the Redis key-value store. Consequently, you should become acquainted with both of these frameworks. Throughout the SDR documentation, each section provides links to relevant resources. However, you should become familiar with these topics before reading this guide.

[[get-started:first-steps:spring]]
=== Learning Spring

Spring Data uses Spring framework's https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html[core] functionality, such as the https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html[IoC] container, https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html#resources[resource] abstract, and the https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop[AOP] infrastructure. While it is not important to know the Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is important. At a minimum, the idea behind IoC should be familiar. That being said, the more knowledge you have about the Spring, the faster you can pick up Spring Data Redis. In addition to the Spring Framework's comprehensive documentation, there are a lot of articles, blog entries, and books on the matter. The Spring Guides https://spring.io/guides[home page] offer a good place to start. In general, this should be the starting point for developers wanting to try Spring Data Redis.

[[get-started:first-steps:nosql]]
=== Learning NoSQL and Key Value Stores

NoSQL stores have taken the storage world by storm. It is a vast domain with a plethora of solutions, terms, and patterns (to make things worse, even the term itself has multiple https://www.google.com/search?q=nosoql+acronym[meanings]). While some of the principles are common, it is crucial that you be familiar to some degree with the stores supported by SDR. The best way to get acquainted with these solutions is to read their documentation and follow their examples. It usually does not take more then five to ten minutes to go through them and, if you come from an RDMBS-only background, many times these exercises can be eye-openers.

[[get-started:first-steps:samples]]
=== Trying out the Samples

One can find various samples for key-value stores in the dedicated Spring Data example repo, at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue-examples[https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue-examples]. For Spring Data Redis, you should pay particular attention to the `retwisj` sample, a Twitter-clone built on top of Redis that can be run locally or be deployed into the cloud. See its https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-keyvalue/examples/retwisj/current/[documentation], the following blog https://spring.io/blog/2011/04/27/getting-started-redis-spring-cloud-foundry/[entry] for more information.
