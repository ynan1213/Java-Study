NOTE: As of version 1.1, an important change has been made to the `exec` methods of `RedisConnection` and `RedisTemplate`. Previously, these methods returned the results of transactions directly from the connectors. This means that the data types often differed from those returned from the methods of `RedisConnection`. For example, `zAdd` returns a boolean indicating whether the element has been added to the sorted set. Most connectors return this value as a long, and Spring Data Redis performs the conversion. Another common difference is that most connectors return a status reply (usually the string, `OK`) for operations such as `set`. These replies are typically discarded by Spring Data Redis. Prior to 1.1, these conversions were not performed on the results of `exec`. Also, results were not deserialized in `RedisTemplate`, so they often included raw byte arrays. If this change breaks your application, set `convertPipelineAndTxResults` to `false` on your `RedisConnectionFactory` to disable this behavior.
